        <p>Yes, you read the title right; I use a 2009 polycarbonate unibody MacBook (yes, not the Air or Pro) with OS X 10.9 as my daily computer. I know; you probably have so mnay questions like: why? just why? I promise that I'll answer them later!</p>
        <h3>Why I put myself through this</h3>
        <p>Could it be the nostalgia? Maybe. Or just the beautiful design of the polycarbonate MacBook? Uh, yeah?!</p>
        <p>No, but seriously: why do I use a Mac from 2009 with a version of OS X (ahh, remember the days before macOS?) that's from 2013? There are a number of reasons, but I'll list the <em>main ones</em> below. (Full disclosure: these are my opinions and definitely not facts.)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Older versions of OS X (Aqua!) looked and felt <em>way</em> better than Apple's recent attempts at macOS.</li>
            <li>I like to show up to school with an ancient Mac while everyone else is walking around with their new MacBook Pro M1 Max and iPad Pro combination.</li>
            <li>The design of the MacBook is so much cooler as well as more versatile.</li>
            <li>I'm in the middle of a chellenge in which I <em>only</em> use Mac OS (any version) because I'm normally a Windows user.</li>
            <li>There is a SuperDrive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Okay, so that is my list of the main reasons why I use my MacBook. Let me elaborate!</p>
        <h3>Older versions of OS X are better</h3>
        <p>No, it's true, it's true! While Big Sur and Monterey drastically improved the interface of the Mac OS, nothing can beat the beauty and art of Aqua. I thought that Yosemite's overhaul back in the day was so cool, but as I reflect upon it now, Apple really did not put enough effort into making the new user interface feel natural.</p>
        <p>Yes, versions 10.10-10.15 of OS X/macOS are just plain ugly.</p>
        <p>Now, confession: I am using 10.9.5 Mavericks, which includes the worst rendition of Aqua since 10.0. But, it still looks way better than the latest OS this computer can run (High Sierra).</p>
