            <p>Hi there, I'm Gavin Ruane! I'm a senior at St. Ignatius College Preparatory, a high school in San Francisco, California, and you've just stumbled upon my website!</p>
            <p>On this website, I like to type up my calculus notes and share them with others. Using \(\LaTeX\) and MathJax, I typeset my math notes so that they're accessible and professional. I mean, who wants to download some nasty PDF when you can use the amazing technologies built into your browser and JavaScript?</p>
            <p>I also like to share some of my projects that I work on in school, like my computer science projects or maybe some big English assignment. But I probably won't share these until I graduate because this freaky girl from Calabasas found a YouTube video of mine explaining my project and <em>demanded</em> that I send her my work. Uh...no? Do your own work girlfriend!</p>
            <p>Have any questions? Feel free to email me! (Note: I don't always check my Outlook email right away, so don't expect an immediate response!)</p>
