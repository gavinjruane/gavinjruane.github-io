        <p>There are two types of properties and changes: Chemical and Physical. But first, let's look at matter and mass.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matter </strong>is anything that takes up space and has mass and volume. An example is a desk, water, and the air. Yes, even the air!</li>
            <li><strong>Mass </strong> is how much matter is in a given area. Mass does not mean weight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now let's look at chemical and physical properties.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>physical property</strong> is something that can be observed without changing an object's identity.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Often times, this includes observations based on your five senses.</li>
                <li>For example: texture, color, boiling point, shape, size, melting point, current phase, freezing point.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Phases of Matter</strong> (physical property)</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid: </strong>definite volume and shape, particles packed in a fixed position.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid: </strong>definite volume but indefinite shape, particles are close together, but not in a fixed position.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas: </strong>indefinite volume and shape, particles are at a greater distance from each other.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A <strong>chemical property</strong> is generally an object's ability to transform into a new substance.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It describes how a substance reacts, or doesn't react, to another substance.</li>
                <li>For example: Gas formation (not by boiling), changing to a solid (not by freezing, precipitate), gain or loss of energy, new color</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
