                                  <h3 class="content">June 1, 2022 &#8226; Blog</h3>
                                  <p>Yes, you read the title right; I use a 2009 polycarbonate unibody MacBook (yes, not the Air or Pro) with OS X 10.9 as my daily computer. I know; you probably have so mnay questions like: why? just why? I promise that I'll answer them later!</p>
                                    <h3>Why I put myself through this</h3>
                                    <p>Could it be the nostalgia? Maybe. Or just the beautiful design of the polycarbonate MacBook? Uh, yeah?!</p>
                                    <p>No, but seriously: why do I use a Mac from 2009 with a version of OS X (ahh, remember the days before macOS?) that's from 2013? There are a number of reasons, but I'll list the <em>main ones</em> below. (Full disclosure: these are my opinions and definitely not facts.)</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Older versions of OS X (Aqua!) looked and felt <em>way</em> better than Apple's recent attempts at macOS.</li>
                                        <li>I like to show up to school with an ancient Mac while everyone else is walking around with their new MacBook Pro M1 Max and iPad Pro combination.</li>
                                        <li>The design of the MacBook is so much cooler as well as more versatile.</li>
                                        <li>I'm in the middle of a chellenge in which I <em>only</em> use Mac OS (any version) because I'm normally a Windows user.</li>
                                        <li>There is a SuperDrive.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Okay, so that is my list of the main reasons why I use my MacBook. Let me elaborate!</p>
                                    <h3>Older versions of OS X are better</h3>
                                    <p>No, it's true, it's true! While Big Sur and Monterey drastically improved the interface of the Mac OS, nothing can beat the beauty and art of Aqua. I thought that Yosemite's overhaul back in the day was so cool, but as I reflect upon it now, Apple really did not put enough effort into making the new user interface feel natural.</p>
                                    <p>Yes, versions 10.10-10.15 of OS X/macOS are just plain ugly.</p>
                                    <p>Now, confession: I am using 10.9.5 Mavericks, which includes the worst rendition of Aqua since 10.0. But, it still looks way better than the latest OS this computer can run (High Sierra). High Sierra just doesn't look right on the polycarbonate unibody MacBook.</p>
                                    <h3>Updated confession</h3>
                                    <p>Well, I've had to move on. For the second semester of my senior year, I upgraded&mdash;to a unibody 2010 MacBook Pro 15"! Sure, it was just one year newer than my previous Mac, but, oh wow, the performance boost with the i5 compared to the Core 2 Duo in the MacBook is <em>amazing</em>. Seriously. Everything else between the machines is the same; they have the same 2.5" SSD and same 8 GB of RAM, which just shows <em>how much better</em> the i5 in my MacBook Pro is.</p>
                                    <p>Initially, I stuck to Mavericks on the MacBook Pro, but one day, it bricked itself. Yes, I saw that blinking folder icon. Thankfully, I had High Sierra in another partition (only because my stupid high school used this shitty program called Lockdown Browser for tests&mdash;seriously, the <strong>shittiest</strong> app I've ever used), so I was able to retrieve my files on the Mavericks partition. I used High Sierra for a while, but let's be honest&mdash;High Sierra is really just so gross.</p>
                                    <p>So, I used <em>dosdude1</em>'s Catalina Patcher to install Catalina on my MacBook Pro. Wow, what an improvement over High Sierra. Plus, most apps still support Catalina. I mean, I felt like I'm using a modern Mac! Okay, things like video editing or gaming aren't not up to par with the latest Intel Macs, but normal productivity stuff is great. I usually have Mail, Pages, Music, and Firefox (with a few tabs) open, and the computer runs perfecly! I mean, the bottom of the machine could be mistaken for a lap heater, but otherwise, there aren't any performance issues or anything. It ran so well that I put Catalina on the 2009 MacBook too. It doesn't run as perfectly on the MacBook, but it is totally usable. That Core 2 Duo!!</p>
                                    <p>I would totally continue using my 2009 and 2010 Macs next year at university, but I have to get a PC for my computer engineering major. So rude! It does mean that I get to buy an all-new, fully-loaded Dell XPS, which is exciting, but let's be honest, an XPS is no Mac&mdash;especially not my 2009 and 2010 Macs!</p>
