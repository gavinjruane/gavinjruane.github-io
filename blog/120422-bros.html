                                  <p>Oh, do I have thoughts about this movie!</p>
                                  <!-- Use h3 for section headings -->

First of all, I had high hopes for this movie. Okay, as high as rom-com hopes can go. Maybe on the level of He's Just Not That Into You or something. Oh, and He (me, Gavin) Is Just Not That Into You, Bros!

The characters are incredibly annoying, and not in an intentional and funny way. Billy Eichner's character was the worst, in my opinion; at times, I wanted to tell him to stop talking because his little rants were so annoying and went on for way too long. 

Plus, the whole film was about how Billy's character hates himself and thinks he's ugly, too gay, and whatnot. I actually don't mind what the writers were going for here, which I'm assuming was that there is a lot of judgement in the gay community, but they failed significantly. The self-loathing comes off as really tone-deaf, especially when Billy's character uses it to claim that Aaron doesn't want to be with him. "Oh my god, shut up!" I groaned whenever this happened.

That doesn't mean that this movie wasn't hilarious though. Some of the jokes had me laughing so hard that I had to pause the movie for a moment! The polyamorous Hallmark movie or the Sarah Paulsen Home Alone—oh, that was funny! (And hey, I would love a Sarah Paulsen Home Alone!) It was in those moments that I told myself, "Oh, that annoying part was just a little error because this movie is funny!"

But I was wrong. The annoyances never ceased. I liked viewing, but I will never watch this again. You know what I probably will watch again? Latter Days. At least that movie knew it was bad!
