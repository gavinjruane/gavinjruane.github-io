							      <h2>About Me</h2>
						            <p>Hi there, I'm Gavin Ruane! I'm a student based in San Francisco, California, and you've just stumbled upon my website!</p>
						            <p>On this website, I like to type up my calculus notes and share them with others. Using \(\LaTeX\) and MathJax, I typeset my math notes so that they're accessible and professional. I mean, who wants to download some nasty PDF when you can use the amazing technologies built into your browser and JavaScript?</p>
						            <p>I also like to share some of my projects that I work on in school, like my computer science projects or maybe some big English assignment. But I probably won't share these because this freaky girl from Calabasas found a YouTube video of mine explaining my project and <em>demanded</em> that I send her my work. Uh...no? Do your own work!</p>
						            <p>Have any questions? Feel free to email me! (Note: I don't always check my Outlook email right away, so don't expect an immediate response!)</p>

							      <h1 class="content">I am officially anti-Subway.</h1>
							      <h3 class="content">October 12, 2022 &#8226; Blog</h3>
							      <p class="content">Okay, why would anyone ever choose to voluntarily eat at Subway? Seriously! I'm sitting here in the Kennedy Library at 8:00 PM, and there are multiple people eating Subway sandwiches. Gross and disgusting! (Might I add that one of the people will not cover his mouth and is spewing his coughs everywhere!)</p>
							</div>
							<div class="image-text">
								  <img class="image-text" id="image-of-brody" src="./../assets/images/Brody.jpg">
							      <p class="image-text">I mean, let's first talk about how their sandwiches are wrapped. So many people walk around all day with their "sandwiches" (if you can call them that!) in their little dog poop bags. Yes, that's what I'm comparing them to. Whenever I walk my dog Brody (pictured at left), I carry around his little poop bags, and let me tell you: the Subway bags sound exactly the same. That definitely speaks to the quality of the sandwiches, just saying! It's honestly embarassing. If I were you, I wouldn't be showing my Subway bag so proudly because it shows how much class you have&mdash;none!</p>
							 </div>
							 <div class="top-part" style="margin-top: 20px">
							      <p class="content">Secondly, don't go fooling yourself saying, "Oh, it's so healthy! I can get a sandwich that is so healthy for a great price and a great taste!" No, you cannot. It is not healthy, nor does it taste good. (The taste is subjective, but my argument still stands.) To argue that a Subway sandwich is healthy though is ridiculous. Just because there are three tomatoes does not mean that your proceesed meat, Kraft single cheese slice, preservative-filled mayonnaise, and FDA-classified cake bread are healthy too. And people are going to argue and say, "Oh, but you can get a different meat!" or, "Oh, you can just get the sandwich without bread!" No, all of the meats are heavily processed, and no, who the F wants a sandwich without bread? It's not a sandwich then!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="top-part">
							      <p class="content">I mean, it's really just shocking to me. I wonder if Subway enjoyers have eaten at other delis before. For example, I'm from the San Francisco area, and I love Ravioli House. Are their sandwiches healthy? No. But do they use real ingredients and fresh bread? Yes. Do they have unique and flavorful sandwiches? Yes. They also have wondeful service! Every time I go in there, the employees ask about my mother and my school life. Would I get any of that in a Subway? No. Point-blank.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="top-part">
								<p class="content">Well, that's all I'm going to say regarding Subway. I don´t want to put any more mental energy into its repulsiveness! Final thoughts: if you eat Subway, reconsider your life.</p>
