                  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Songs in the Feminist Realm</h1>
                  <p>In this part of my "mixtape," I chose to include some songs to which I enjoy listening that connect with some of the themes we've explored as a class in WGQS 201 this quarter. The playlist is available on Spotify (embedded playlist below), but you can also search for each song on your music platform of choice using the "annotated list" I've included below. For each song, I've written a little about why I wanted that song to be a part of my "A Selection of Songs in the Feminist Realm playlist.</p>
                  <p><em>Tip: You can log into Spotify after you click play on the playlist to listen to the entire playlist right here!</em></p>
                  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1rLfa79nKXtUy1wzzbBklQ?utm_source=generator" width="90%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                  <ol>
                    <li id="monae">Americans (Janelle Monáe)</li>
                    <p>This song is one of my favorite Janelle Monáe tracks. So many of her other songs address injustices and oppression in this nation, but I believe that "Americans" is one of the most witty and insightful songs she's released. Monáe openly criticizes the policies and cultural instincts of both past and present America through an almost satirical patriotic voice. I like this song as an introduction to recognizing that the United States is <em>not</em> a perfect nation. I've played this song for my family before, and it's definitely pushed them to think about their position in this country.</p>
                    <li id="fapple">Regret (Fiona Apple)</li>
                    <p>"Regret" by Fiona Apple is one of my favorite songs. Apple's range of emotions in this song never fails to give me chills and at times move me to tears. While not specifically a feminist song, "Regret" does include a compelling example of a woman's passionate anger ignored and tossed away by a man. I like listening to this song when I'm angry about something because it reminds me that there are other people out there who are angry like me. I keep coming back to this theme of women's anger because the materials I've encountered on the topic have really educated me on the importance of anger and how it has been limited.</p>
                    <li id="hamilton">The Schuyler Sisters (The Cast of Hamilton)</li>
                    <p>I am a big fan of musical theatre, but I really didn't enjoy <em>Hamilton</em> all that much up until recently. My favorite song from Hamilton is probably "Helpless," but a close second would be "The Schuyler Sisters," a track focusing on both the empowerment of women and important historical themes. This song wrestles with themes of classism and sexism, and it does it well. I especially enjoy this song from the musical because it retells and emphasizes a story of women during an era in which women's stories were ignored. The Schuyler sisters express themselves as intelligent, capable, and independent young women, ideas that would likely not be expressed in history textbooks.</p>
                    <li id="sophie">Immaterial (SOPHIE)</li>
                    <p>This is one of my favorite songs from SOPHIE, a transgender visionary for modern and experimental pop music. This song creatively explores the concepts of gender and being transgender by expressing its creator's emotions through upbeat and exciting electronic music. The message I take away from this song is that gender is such an "immaterial" concept, or an idea that is archaic and limiting. "I can be anything I want," as SOPHIE (and contributing artist Cecile Believe) sings in her song.</p>
                    <li id="electra">Flamboyant (Dorian Electra)</li>
                    <p>Dorian Electra is one of my favorite up-and-coming artists; their music attempts to create a universe for LGBTQ+ people who are searching for themselves through harsh instrumentation, witty lyrics, and satirical themes. I chose this song out of Electra's fantastic discography because it relates to one of the core themes of this course: gender is <em>not</em> a simple binary-based concept. Electra themself is a non-binary artist who enjoys mocking the gender binary through their music videos and performances. "Flamboyant" celebrates their identity and pushes away those that attempt to restrict them into the traditional gender binary. I found this song especially therapeutic for me when I was a little younger and felt insecure about my homosexuality.</p>
