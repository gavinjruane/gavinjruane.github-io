                    <li id="blog">"feministkilljoys" blog</li>
                    <p>I know that this is a site that Dr. Ednie provided to our class as a focus for a project, but I really want to highlight it. Wow, I loved this site. I spent hours on this site exploring the author's thoughts, feelings, discussions, and conversations with her audience. I personally am incredibly grateful for the "feministkilljoys" blog for two reasons: first of all, it let me feel my anger about issues in this country, and second of all, it inspired my further interest in this topic.</p>
                    <p>This site truthfully did provide an incredible learning oppotunity for me. When I came into this course, I already considered myself a feminist, but I did not understand my role in feminist discourse and conversation. This blog assisted me in directing my thoughts in a clear and <em>useful</em> manner, and for that, I am incredibly grateful. I want to keep reading, studying, and hearing about the topics I've explored in this class, and I thank this blog for helping me realize my passion for these topics.</p>
                    <p>Oh, and of course, it inspired the title for this project, which I am proud of because it accurately describes how I feel and what I've explored and learned.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Visit this site: <a href="https://feministkilljoys.com/" class="any-link">https://feministkilljoys.com/</a></p>

                    <li id="politics">bell hooks' "Feminist Politics: Where We Stand"</li>
                    <p>The first reading we ever did for this class, bell hooks' "Feminist Politics: Where We Stand," launched me into this exciting and important conversation on feminism, oppression, and politics. I was incredibly inspired by this reading, and I am being completely honest when I say that I think about it almost daily.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I have used this reading in discussions with my family about the topic of feminism. My uncle&mdash;one of those guys who says, "Well, why should I be a feminist? I'm a man!"&mdash;was commenting on my choice of a women's and gender studies class over some other social studies course when I introduced him to bell hooks´ definition of feminism. I know he didn't want to admit it, but I could tell by looking at his face that he was shocked that the version of feminism he knew&mdash;the false, misleading perspectives portrayed in popular media&mdash;was wrong. Yes, Uncle:feminism is a movement to end sexist and other types of oppression. It's not a movement to exterminate men.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Read "Feminist Politics: Where We Stand" in the second edition of <em>Introduction to Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies</em> or by <a href="./../../assets/files/hooks_fem_politics.pdf" class="any-link">clicking here</a>.</p>

                    <li id="hooks">Berea College's resources on bell hooks anf feminism</li>
                    <p>This selected suggestion is more of a quicker and less-involved read than the previous site, but I still think it is a great resource. I've found this site to be incredibly useful in understanding and learning about feminism as a concept, as well as the insightful bell hooks herself.</p>
                    <p>I think that a site like this is perfect for people who aren't familiar with the true concept of feminism, especially people like my uncle who are skewed by popular portrayals of feminists and feminism. Sometimes, people just need a quick and pithy way to learn about what feminism really is, and I appreciate sites like this one that provide such information in a readable and understandable way.</p>

                    <li id="chin">Staceyanń Chin's "Feminist or a Womanist"</li>
                    <p>When I first watched this poem, I was paralyzed. Reading this poem will give the reader a sense of Staceyann Chin's perspective in this poem, but this performance really is incredible. I usually don't rewatch most videos, but I think I replayed this video at least ten times because it was that moving to me.</p>
                    <p>I'm including this performance on this page mostly because it's one of my favorite poems and performances, but I also think that it's an incredibly insightful and passionate creation on what it means to be a woman and a feminist. Like with many of the other concepts on which I've focused for this final Praxis project, this poem works with my goal and desire for people unaware of "true feminism" to comprehend it.</p>
