                  <h1 id="start" style="margin-bottom: 0;">That Was Mean Spirited!</h1>
                  <p>The following video is a clip from the reality television show <em>Dance Moms</em> on the Lifetime Network. Watch the video from 7:42 to 10:00.</p>
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkJ1g8b_pE4" target="_blank" class="any-link">Click here to view the video on YouTube.</a>
                  <iframe width="560" height="500" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LkJ1g8b_pE4?start=463" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                  <p>You may be wondering: why would I include a clip from <em>Dance Moms</em> in my Praxis project? I admit that I enjoy watching the show, which contributed to my knowledge of this clip, but that's not why I find it appropriate for this project.</p>
                  <p>I actually think it fits in very well with some of the themes we explored in this course this year. While watching the clip, you will notice that the women, especially Abby Lee Miller and Holly, are battling each other over the young girl's placement in a dance. The context of the clip is not really important; however, the fact that this clip exists and has thousands of views on the Internet <em>is</em> important.</p>
                  <p>People all over the Internet make edits of the Dance Moms screaming at each other and at Abby Lee Miller because it's funny. Why is it funny though? Why is it so ridiculously hilarious to watch? The answer is: it's a woman on woman argument.</p>
                  <h1 style="font-size: 35px; margin-bottom: 0;">“We can be angry when we stay in our lanes...We can be angry at other women, because who doesn't love a good catfight?.”</h1>
                  <p><em>- Soraya Chemaly, "The Power of Women's Anger"</em></p>
                   <div id="chemaly" cstyle="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/soraya_chemaly_the_power_of_women_s_anger" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
                  <p>In her TED talk, Soraya Chemaly speaks on the idea that women should be angry about oppressions and issues they face in their lives, but she also comments on how other people perceive women's anger. I've included a relevant quote from this TED talk above, which comments on our American cultural enjoyment of women battling other women. Shows like <em>Dance Moms</em> feed into this accepted craving for women's catfights and instill in us that women's anger directed toward each other is acceptable, and even further, it should be celebrated.</p>
                  <p>However, when women wish to express their anger on real issues, they're ridiculed and belittled. In a speech at the National Women's Studies Conference, Audre Lorde includes multiple instances of when she was encouraged to "tone down" her anger or express it in other ways so she didn't offend people. Below, I've also included an example of a video I found online of two women talking about abortion. One of the women is anti-abortion and wishes to criminalize it, while the other&mdash;who is an "angry feminist"&mdash;is challenging the other woman's views. Watch the video up until the 3:30 mark. (After that, it's just not worth it.)</p>
                  <a id="lorde" href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1981-audre-lorde-uses-anger-women-responding-racism/" style="text-decoration: underline;" class="any-link">Click this link to read Audre Lorde's speech.</a>
                  <p>This video is by no means a perfect example of some of the concepts portrayed and publicized by Audre Lorde and Soraya Chemaly, but I think it gives us a glimpse of how women who are angry about the circumstances in which they are forced to live are treated by others. The young woman who is (rightfully) angry about the demonstrator's thoughts on abortion is labeled an "angry feminist" to dismiss her point of view as invalid and unimportant. There are countless examples of this type of dismissal on the Internet and out in the world. People who diminish women's anger to nonsense use fallacies to justify their ridicule of angry women, and this fallacious behavior cannot be tolerated.</p>
                  <p>The fact that this interview involves two women in an argument makes the young woman's anger even more susceptible to ridicule. The woman representing a pro-life argument is seen as the "righteous" woman, while the other is diminished for her views. "[This woman has] been fooled," a comment says. Another person writes, "these women are well beyond hope." It's easy to demean a woman when she's passionately angry about a topic.</p>
                  <iframe id="angryfem" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p9g_8dDTEww" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                  <p>I don't want to argue that the young woman in the video is completely factual and correct in all of her views&mdash;I can´t back her up on everything. However, I want to emphasize the ridicule she faced for expressing her anger at something.</p>
                  <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
                  <p>I chose to include this page, along with my thoughts and analysis of feminist anger, in my mixtape because I want people to understand how women's and feminist anger is perceived by others. No, a man's anger and a woman's anger are not viewed the same by the public. Whether it's Dance Mom Holly telling Abby Lee Miller that she was "mean spirited," or we're listening to established thinkers Audre Lorde and Soraya Chemaly discuss their opinions passionately, women face intensified scrutiniy for expressing anger and passion for their views.</p>
