                  <p>Welcome to my personal website! On this page, I am reflecting on my experiences in CPE 100 this quarter and my time at Cal Poly so far. I designed, created, and developed this entire website by myself to represent who I am, and I am including my reflection on here as a testament to my goals and experiences as a budding computer engineer.</p>
                  <h2 id="experience">My Class Experience</h2>
                  <div class="image-text">
                  <img class="image-text" id="map-image" src="./../assets/images/sticker.png">
                    <p class="image-text">As a student in Dr. Slivovsky's CPE 100 course this fall quarter, I deepened my passion for technology and explored the incredible opportunities that the CPE department offers for its students. Listening to some of my classmates' experience in computing fields initially worried me, but through this course, I realized that I can succeed as a student with the support of my peers and faculty members. Exploring the various aspects of the CPE curriculum and opportunities for its students excited me for the experiences in which I can participate in the future.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3 id="assignment" style="margin-bottom: 0;">My favorite assignment</h3>
                  <p>I particularly enjoyed the "Sticker Design" project for this course. (My sticker design is included above.) This assignment encouraged me to consider the question of inclusivity in the CPE department and at Cal Poly while pushing me to express my creativity. For this project, I illustrated a Macintosh Performa with a pride flag on the display. Both of these concepts represent important aspects of my own life, and I wanted to express that everyone&mdash;including people like me&mdash;could participate in CPE!</p>
                  <p>As any visitor can likely deduce, I designed my website to emulate a classic Macintosh from around the System 6 era (late 1980s to early 1990s). I consider myself a connoisseur of computer history, and this era&mdash;the System 6 era&mdash;is one of my favorites. I incorporated my passion for computer history into my sticker design by depicting a classic Macintosh. I wanted to represent my own passions while also recognizing the incredible diverse history of computer pioneers that have contributed to our current knowledge about technology.</p>
                  <p>On the monitor is a pride flag, which I believe represents inclusivity and connection between all people. As a gay person, I struggled to see how I would fit into a field like computer engineering, but I've realized that I will have a community that will support me for who I am.</p>
                  <h2 id="overall">This Quarter Overall</h2>
                  <p>I will admit&mdash;this quarter has not been easy for me! Moving away from home for the first time, exploring a new way of life, forming new relationships, and adjusting to university life has challenged me as a person.</p>
                  <p>I have especially struggled with adjusting to college-level standards. My high school held high expectations for its students, although it rewarded one's accumulation of work and quantity of assignments rather than the quality one exerted into the work. I've been so used to writing wordy paragraphs and long assignments to please my instructors that I haven't focused on refining the quality of my work. I know that I haven't overcome this challenge, but I know that my progress as a student points me toward my position as a successful student.</p>
                  <p>I look forward to next quarter when I'll take my first computer science course (CSC 101)! I cannot wait to develop my skills as a computer engineer as well as a student and well-rounded person.</p>
